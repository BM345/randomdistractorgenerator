    <h1>Random Distractor Generator</h1>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>This simple web app can generate a set of distractors based on the answer key to a question. The
      distractors are random, but the values will all be within range of the value given as the answer
      key.
    </p>
    <p>When you hit 'Go', the app looks at the answer key you gave it. The first thing it does is to identify
      which part of it is the number and which is the units. When it gives you the distractors, it puts
      the same units on each one that were in the key.</p>
    <p>The app then tries to figure out how many significant figures the answer key was written to - so
      that you don't have to enter this value yourself. It's reasonably good at guessing, and it'll tell
      you how many significant figures it thinks the number is given to just above the list of distractors
      it generates.</p>
    <p>There are some numbers which are ambiguous as to how many significant figures they are given - i.e.,
      2200. This number could be given to 2, 3, or 4 significant figures (unlike a number like 2200.0,
      which is definitely to 5). There is a checkbox on the screen which, if ticked, when the app is
      given a number like 2200, it will assume the lower number of significant figures - in this case
      2. If the checkbox is unticked, it will assume the higher number of significant figures - in this
      case 4.</p>
    <p>Once the app knows to how many significant figures the distractors should be given, it generates
      a number of distractors. You can change how many distractors it generates using the 'number of
      distractors' textbox. The default is 4.</p>
    <p>The app generates distractors that are in a given range - the range extends above and below the key
      by the amount given in the 'spread' field.</p>
    <p>Hitting 'Go' will generate a new set of distractors. You can keep hitting 'Go' until you get a set
      you like.</p>
    <p>You can copy the set of distractors the app gives you by hitting the 'Copy' button.</p>
